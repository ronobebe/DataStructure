So HashMap is in various form but the core responsibility of hasMap is simple Unique Key and values.
HashMap, HashTable, HashSet
LinkedHashMap, LinkedHashSet
ConcurrentHashMap

HashSet are internally call HashMaps Only so we just need to know HashMaps.
HashTable is simply a HashMap but its Synchronised and it does not allow null values in Both Key and values.

Separate Chaining Technique, Please note there are other open addressing techniques like double hashing and linear probing
whose efficiency is almost same as to that of separate chaining

Linear Probing(Primary clustering, Secondary Clustering), Double hashing, Quadratic probing.
